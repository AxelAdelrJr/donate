							The total number of cryptocurrency owners by the end of 2023 increased by 34% from 432
							million to 580 million.
							<br>
							<br>
							Bitcoin is owned by 33% more investors than the previous yearâ€”296 million (51% of total
							cryptocurrency owners).
							<br>
							<br>
							The main catalysts for the popularization of digital assets over the past year include the
							adoption of ETFs and increased demand from institutional investors.
							<br>
							<br>
							This is what you will find in public reports, but in reality, people love Bitcoin because
							you can make money on it. People see the growth from $17,000 to $73,000 and think, why am I
							not doing this!
							<br>
							<br>
							You go on YouTube, watch videos about Bitcoin, start learning technical analysis, try to
							understand what it all means, you start reading popular cryptocurrency publications, listen
							to podcasts, subscribe to Telegram channels, and find people on X (Twitter) you can trust.
							<br>
							<br>
							If you've read up to these lines, you've likely already benefited from my daily free market
							analysis of Bitcoin. I believe this is the case, but I also know that no successful product
							in the world can exist without financial support.
							This is the edge that helps move our world in a better direction, and it's unlikely that
							Google or Apple would have become such companies if they had not received financial support
							at an early stage.
							<br>
							<br>
							I believe in people, believe in their sincerity because I try to help them navigate the
							complex and sometimes confusing world of on-chain analysis. If you think what I am doing
							helps you, I would be glad if you made a donation, as it is clear that this support will
							help me understand that what I am doing is truly needed by you and that you appreciate it.
							<br>
							<br>
							Thank you,
							<br>
							AAJ.
